# MinimalAdmin

A small Sinatra based admin.  
Only has support for   [sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) for now at least.  
You probably should use [RailsAdmin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin),
[Active Admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin) or [Administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate) instead.
